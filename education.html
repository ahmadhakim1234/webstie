<td><p><mark>This is where I started my journey as a student which was way back around 2007. This school hold back so many sweet and bitter memory. I actually still remember most of my teachers that taught me during my primary school most of them already move to a different school and some of them are still there. Not to forget some of my friends that I still keep in contact with untill today. This is also the first time I face a huge chapter of my life which is the UPSR examination which I was very nervous back then but thankfully I did well on those examination.</mark></p></td>

<td><p><mark>This is my high school which I have most of my memories there and friends there because It's only been 3 years since I graduated from SMKBTHO(2) I still remember and still keep in contact with most of my friends and my teachers during the high school period. I still visit the teachers whenever I have the time because to me they are very valuble to me and maybe they can help me for my assignment at my university.</mark></p></td>

<td><p><mark>This is my current place of learning which is at Universiti Teknologi Mara Sungai Petani and this is my last semester. This is actually the first time I stayed away from home because of learning. To be honest, the first semester was very hard for me because I've never been seperated from my family and frieds but I manage to make new friends and make this place as comfortable as my home back in Cheras. It is a bit sad that I coulden't finish my studies with my friends at the campus because of the pandemic that we are in right now but I hope that one day I'll be able to see them again.</mark> </p></td>
